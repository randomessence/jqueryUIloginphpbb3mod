jQuery UI Modal Login Form
==========================

----------


This is a phpbb 3 mod that pretty much just loads :

`jQuery 1.8.2`

`jQuery UI 1.9.0`

Into overall header of the Prosilver Style. That is not all it does though.

The main function of this mod is to replace the standard login link with a button that fire a pop up / modal
login form.

This is a html form styled by jQueryUI. **It has potential**. 

So in terms of phpbb 3 edits, the mod is minor. What is does is add the potential to many things such as:

**Style :** many things can be styled and managed using the exisisting Framework. make us of the icon sets, ccs and range of the many themes available.

**Create :** Make use of the many plugins and widgets that jqueryUI comes bundled with. An example of this is the accordian spoiler bbcode i have already created. simple javascript snippets can be made to do some cool stuff.

##Theme Changing

with the release of v1.1.0 you can manually eneter a value in the acp for the theme folder containing the .css

##Addons

Since this mod loads jquery Ui into Style we can use it for other cool stuff as well. 

##Accordion Spoilers

**With the use of 2 special and custom bbcodes we can create jQuery UI spoilers using the Accordian feature.**
